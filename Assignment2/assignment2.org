* Question 1

** Part A
\emph{2-D mesh}ï¼š\\
 	diameter: 2 \times (\sqrt{36}-1) = 10 \\
 	width: \sqrt{36} = 6 \\
\emph{2-D torus}: \\ 
	diameter: 2 \times (\sqrt{36}/2) = 6 \\
	width: 2 \times \sqrt{36} = 12\\
\emph{6-D cube} : \\
	diameter: 6\\
	width: 18\\

The 6-D hypercube is the best alternative, since when we design a high performance multicomputer platform, we expect lower diameter and higher width so that the parallel computer can require communication  between pairs of nodes with costing less time and require a large amount of data at one time.

** Part B
The current address X is 101010 for nodes 42 and the destination address Y is 001101 for node 13.
1. Exclusive OR: 100111
2. The most significent 1-bit: 6th bit.
3. Negate the 6th bit address: 001010.
4. Exclusive OR: 000111
5. The most significent 1-bit: 3rd bit
6. Negate the 3rd bit: 001110
7. Exclusive OR: 000011
8. The most significent 1-bit: 2nd bit
9. Negate the 2nd bit: 001100
10. Exclusive OR: 000001
11. The most siginicent 1-bit: 1st bit
12. Exclusive OR: 001101

* Question 2
** Data size varies
s + np = 0.12 + 0.88 \times 56 = 49.4 \\
49.4 \times 2.5 = 123.5Gflops
** Data size fixed
1/(0.12 + 0.888/n) = n/(0.12n + 0.88) =  7.36
7.36 \times 2.5 = 18.42Gflops

* Question 3
1. 00 output port0 of  A1
2. 10 output  port2 of B1
3. 11 output port port3 of C2
4. Arrive at Node 9
